# QWERTY: AGAIN!
After too many failed attempts and simplifications, QWERTY finally half-works!
## Specials
I decided that the letters in the program's name would run trivial programs. And it works!
* `q`: Hello, World!
* `w`: Cat(one line :( )
* `e`: Quine(logs `e`)

The other letters&#x2026;I will implement later.
## Standard
QWERTY uses 256 memcells of chars. Various operators can combine adjacent memcells.
